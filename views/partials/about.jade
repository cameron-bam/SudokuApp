		h3(class="section-header") How to Play Sudoku
		p Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle, where the object is to fill out each square on a 9x9 grid with a number between 1 and 9 such that:
			ul
				li Each row of the 9 x 9 grid contains all of the digits between 1 and 9
				li Each column of the 9 x 9 contains all of the digits between 1 and 9
				li Each 3 x 3 sub-grid contains all of the digits between 1 and 9
		h3(class="section-header") History of Sudoku
		p Conceptually, the origins of Sudoku puzzles can be found in combinatorial mathematics.  A 
			|	 completed puzzle is a special kind of latin square, which as 
			a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square") can be defined
			|	as an 
			em	n x n array 
			|	filled with 
			em	n
			|	 different symbols, each occuring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.
			|	 Latin squares were notably 
			a(href="http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E530.html") described by mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1782
			|	 and by 
			a(href="http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/euler-squares-introduction") others 
			|	 in the years since then.
		p The name "Sudoku"  
			a(href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sudoku") originates
			|	 from the abbreviation of the Japanese words 
			em sÅ«ji wa dokushin ni kagiru,
			|	 which mean "the numerals must remain single" (as opposed to double, or double digit).
			|	  Maki Kaji coined the term in 1984, when he 
			a(href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/business/worldbusiness/21sudoku.html?_r=0") first published the modern version of the puzzle
			|	  in a magazine owned by his publication company, Nikoli.
		p Up until 2004, Sudoku remained relatively unknown to the world outside of Japan.  That year,
			|	 Wayne Gould, a retired judge and lawyer from New Zealand, convinced 
			em	The Times
			|	 of London to run a Sudoku puzzle.  The paper saw an increase in sales, which inspired 
			|	 other publications to run the puzzle as well.  A little over two years later, the puzzles were being published 
			a(href="http://nymag.com/arts/all/features/17244/index1.html") across the globe.
		h3(class="section-header") About Express Sudoku
		p This app allows users to create a Sudoku puzzle, save the puzzle to the server hosting this app,
			|	 and then load the puzzle again from the All Puzzles page. Users can attempt to solve 
			|	 these puzzles themselves, or they can use the page's puzzle solving feature to find a
			|	 solution.  If the user wants to solve the puzzle themselves, but ends up getting stuck,
			|	 there is a hint mode on the board that will reveal the following information:
			ul
				li Whether one of the filled in numbers breaks the rules of sudoku
				li If an empty box can't be filled in based on the other values of boxes on the board(could be caused by a poor puzzle prompt)
				li If an empty box has only one possible value based on the values of the other boxes on the board
		h3(class="section-header") Implementation  
		p The entire stack of Express Sudoku is written in Javascript.  The client-side app uses the 
			|	 AngularJS framework, while the server-side app uses the Express framework for Node.js.
			|	 Puzzles are saved to flat-files, so there is no database invovled.  This allows all of 
			|	 the source code to be stored in a GitHub repository.  Sudoku puzzles are solved by using
			|	 a recursive DFS algorithm.  The steps are:
			ol
				li Start at the first empty box on the grid, fill in the box with a possible value
				li Update the possible values of the other boxes on the grid
				li Move to the next empty square, and repeat the previous two steps
				li If no possible values exist for an empty box, or all possible values for a box have been exhausted, return to the box that was previously filled in and choose another possible value
